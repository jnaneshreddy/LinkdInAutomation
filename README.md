# LinkedIn Designer Search Automation (Java + Selenium)

This project is a **Java-based Selenium automation script** that logs into LinkedIn, searches for profiles with the keyword **"Designer"**, extracts the names from the search results, and saves them into a **CSV file**.

### How to Set Environment Variables:

#### On Windows (Command Prompt):

```bash
setx LINKEDIN_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
setx LINKEDIN_PASSWORD "your-secure-password"
```

#### On Mac/Linux (Terminal):

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Limitations

* LinkedIn strictly prohibits scraping or automation without explicit permission. Use this script responsibly.
* The current script only captures names from the **first page** of search results.
* Handling pagination, scrolling, or deeper data extraction requires additional logic and API-compliant methods.
* Ensure ChromeDriver's version matches your Google Chrome browser version to avoid compatibility issues.
